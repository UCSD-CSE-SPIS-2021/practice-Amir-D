# Hello, SPIS! My name is Amir Dhami and I am a data science major attending John Muir college. I am from Seattle, Washington and I hope to learn about ML through this program. 
# In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing basketball and chess, and spending time with my dog. I am looking forward to what this program brings!
